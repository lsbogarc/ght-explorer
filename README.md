# ght-explorer
Interactive simulator for the GHT migration model. Use the Impregnation Index (Ii) to calculate contact outcomes by triangulating demographic mass (M), technological hardware (T), and metadata synchronization (S). Resolves anomalies like Population Y through a systems-logic framework. Companion to Zenodo DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18370723.

# Metadata Triangulation Simulator
This tool is a digital companion to the research paper:
**"The Global Hydro-Logic Tectonic: A Unified Systems Model of Cognitive Biogeography"**###

The Impregnation Index (Ii)

The simulator quantifies the "Typological Friction" described in the GHT framework to predict if a migration pulse will result in a **Systemic Overprint** or **"Going Faint"** (Metadata Handshake).

Ii =  ((M + T)/(1 + S)) - 1
**M (Mass):** Demographic weight/volume of the incoming pulse.
**T (Technology):** The "Hardware" toolkit (Maritime, Administrative, or Logistical).*
**S (Synchronization):** System compatibility (Linguistic metadata and environmental "OS" match).###

Pulse Taxonomy-
**Acoustic Seed:** (~15,000 BCE) High-tonality, hydrologic "OS."-
**Structural Wedge:** (~4,000 BCE) Administrative simplification, refuge forcing.-
**Domino Pulse:** (~1,500 CE) High-velocity standardization and logistical "flattening."### 🔗 Reference & DOI**Luis Bobo (2026)**
